## Solutions

The advanced capabilities, high speed, increased bandwidth and low latency of 5G will help inspire development of a wide variety of new use cases that include everything from massive numbers of IoT devices that use very few network resources, to smartphones with nearly infinite opportunities to use data, to more complex solutions such as AR/VR and mixed reality that will require massive computing capabilities on the edge of the network. 


### IoT
5G was designed specifically to support the types of massive senor grids and industrial IoT (IIOT) applications we are currently witnessing the emergence of. 
Cutting-edge manufacturing sites, distribution centers and numerous other campus environments can benefit from the deployment of a private 5G infrastructure supporting either 4G or 5G radio access networks.

### Latency

Private 5G can deliver ultra low latency and incredibly high bandwidth connections supporting artificial intelligence-driven applications serving an exploding number of sensors and endpoints. 

### Serveless
Remaining in the private domain, less demanding real-time and non-real-time traffic can be offloaded to edge or core computing power, hosted by managed service providers.


### Architecture
By building this private 5G with cloud-native containerized architecture we will be able to achieve new levels of operational automation, flexibility and adaptability.


## What is a private 5G 

The network core, consisting of software applications, compute, networking and storage is the part of the network that enables IP connectivity between a customer on the private5G network and the services that a customer wants to use such as Internet access, voice calls and enterprise applications.

### autonomy
A higher level of operational autonomy unleashed in the 5G core design will be critical for the next generation of services being enabled by new network technologies

## Private5G benefits

The private5G cloud-native virtualized application in combination with built-in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), will enable the dynamic allocation of the appropriate resources, referred to as network slicing. 
It will also allow for automated network configuration changes, including the ability to scale up or scale down network function capacity - to provide the right service levels and network resources needed for each use case.

In addition to network slicing and dynamic resource allocation, a private 5G will provide other benefits:

+ Real-time resource management of Radio Access Network and virtual network functions
+ Advanced analytics of network data to improve network performance
+ Optimized services between Verizon's fixed and mobile networks
+ Scalable, more cost-efficient architecture
+ Ability to move workloads to fit use case requirements


"The network we are building, from the base of the 5G technology will bring about solutions in manufacturing, retail, entertainment, education and countless other areas we have not even dreamed of yet"
said CEO of Softreck, Tom Sapletta.
 
Following the completion of this successful data session, [Softreck](https://softreck.com) expects to start moving traffic on the private5G in the second half of 2022 with full commercialization in 2023.




## Cloud Solutions

With distributed cloud architectures, local processing allows machine learning algorithms to be applied on massive amounts of data without leaving the security and privacy of the enterprise campus. 

CNFs are built using microservices methodologies, ensuring resiliency and granular scalability and adaptability. CNFs are deployable in public, private or across hybrid multi-access edge compute (MEC) and core cloud architectures, enabling easy adoption by any Managed Service Provider (MSP).

CNAP is a flexible and ultra high performance software packet processing engine developed by Metaswitch to provide the foundation for virtualized network functions that handle data plane traffic such as the 5G User Plane Function (UPF).
