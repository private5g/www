5G was designed specifically to support the types of massive senor grids and industrial IoT (IIOT) applications we are currently witnessing the emergence of. 
Cutting-edge manufacturing sites, distribution centers and numerous other campus environments can benefit from the deployment of a private 5G infrastructure supporting either 4G or 5G radio access networks.

Private 5G can deliver ultra low latency and incredibly high bandwidth connections supporting artificial intelligence-driven applications serving an exploding number of sensors and endpoints. 

Remaining in the private domain, less demanding real-time and non-real-time traffic can be offloaded to edge or core computing power, hosted by managed service providers.



## Cloud Solutions

With distributed cloud architectures, local processing allows machine learning algorithms to be applied on massive amounts of data without leaving the security and privacy of the enterprise campus. 

CNFs are built using microservices methodologies, ensuring resiliency and granular scalability and adaptability. CNFs are deployable in public, private or across hybrid multi-access edge compute (MEC) and core cloud architectures, enabling easy adoption by any Managed Service Provider (MSP).

CNAP is a flexible and ultra high performance software packet processing engine developed by Metaswitch to provide the foundation for virtualized network functions that handle data plane traffic such as the 5G User Plane Function (UPF).
